            <p class="metrics">DESCRIPTION</p> Lenny's only occupation is endless parties with friends. 
            He was used to the fact that his father paid for every whim. In the same city lives with 
            him 15-year-old David, who spends almost all his time at home. David has a congenital heart disease
             and doctors' forecasts are not very comforting. Lenny's father, tired of his son's idleness,
              entrusts David with that. Suddenly, these two become indispensable for each other. 
              Lenny helps the guy to feel the taste for life and realize his dreams, and David, in turn, 
              gives him the opportunity to feel responsible for his life and the lives of those around him.<br>
